		      <p> I started doing my studies in the year 2008 doing Std 1. In the year 2014, I completed my Std 7 and got second-class
		          in my final examinations. After that, in 2015, i got admitted in Molapo High school Leribe. Things went well until i passed
			      my Junoir Certificate with first-class in 2017. I went to another class which is Form D which is popularly known as
		          Grade 11, everything went well there and i moved to the next class doing my final examinations in 2018. Everything still went well there and it was my time to apply for admission in University. </p>

			<p> In the year 2019, I was supposed to apply for Higher Institution. Instead, i just had a break, in fact,
		        i had a full gap year and learnt so many things by that time. In 2021, i applied for Bsc in Software Engineering & Multimedia in Limkokwing University of Creative Technology and applied for Bsc in Computer Networking in Botho University and still got admitted.I chose to go study at Limkokwing University of Creative Technology Lesotho and now, I am in year 2 semester 1, and still hope everything will also go right too.</p>
