             <p> Chess is one of the most game that I love most. During my spare time, in fact, when I have nothing to do,
                I just take more than five games.I play with my opponents via online or physical games.
                This only a sport i love most.
                It really keeps me busy when i have nothing to do.

                 <p>Chess has many advantages as it helps my mind to think think clearly or beyond. And it also helps me
                    to know how to sacrifice, focus and overcome alot of challenges. According to my point of view, it is
                    advisable for many people to practice playing chess as it will help them the most.
